All gpio button pins if button pressed goes to gnd if pin is output maybe ic is FAIL set a resistor to this pins
All gpio button pins have histeresis for fix this use capasitor
Minimum WIDTH 0,5mm HEIGHT 0,5mm TICKNESS 0,125mm
Preferred WIDTH 0,7mm HEIGHT 0,7mm TICKNESS 0,150mm
LM393 Output must has a capasitor for signal extend to easily measure data

watch alarm sistem must be updated
led colors must be updated
V1 setting system is bad
Setting system must be easy for all
Assembly a cheap character lcd to board for setting
